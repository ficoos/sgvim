# SGVIM

Runs SSH with special options so that whenever you use gvim it will actually use th local gvim with the netrw plugin.

Normally useing the netrw plugins is clunky and uncomfortable. Having to specify full paths and retyping the password everytime you open a file is far from ideal.
With this script you don't have to even think about it.


## Usage

    $ sgvim user@hostname.example.com
    user@hostname.example.com's password:
    $ gvim file.txt
